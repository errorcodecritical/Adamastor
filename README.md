    Even as I spoke, an immense shape
    Materialised in the night air,
    Grotesque and enormous stature
    With heavy jowls, and an unkempt beard
    Scowling from shrunken, hollow eyes
    Its complexion earthy and pale,
    Its hair grizzled and matted with clay,
    Its mouth coal black, teeth yellow with decay.
    — Camões, The Lusiads Book V
